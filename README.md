# OurApp
OurApp is a web app made as a hub for friends, partners, etc. to store bucket lists, movie lists, to-do lists, and also has an integrated a Stress Tracker app I made earlier this year. The Stress Tracker allows for people to be able to track and store stressors they’ve noted and also to give advice on others’ stressors. Some other features include a hangout planner, using items from a bucket list to plan a day out, along with a movie night planner giving you all the tools to watch a movie in theaters or at home. I created this app originally for personal use, however am currently working on adapting the program for anyone to use. This app was coded using R Shiny.
A demo version of the app can be found at the following URL:
